Sometimes, I'll write some      code for them to plug the gap. Just occasionally, I'll tidy up the code, add      XML documentation comments etc, and include it in my miscellaneous utility library.      This library will, of course, grow over time.    </p>    <p>      Due to the nature of the library, some of the code may not have been particularly      rigorously tested. You are strongly advised to give it a thorough testing before      including it in any important code. Note: as of November 2006, I'm gradually adding      unit tests, so the quality should improve significantly.    </p>        <h2>Language/framework compatibility and build notes</h2>    <p>      As of February 2008, MiscUtil is built with Visual Studio 2008 and uses features of C# 3.      However, with a bit of jiggery pokery we have it building in two configurations: one targeting      .NET 2.0, and one targeting .NET 3.5. Not all of MiscUtil works with .NET 2.0. Some of it can't,      because it requires significant features such as expression trees. Other parts work with a few      pieces of .NET 3.5 imported. In particular, in the .NET 2.0 build of MiscUtil we've included the      <code>Func</code> and <code>Action</code> delegates, <code>ExtensionAttribute</code> for      extension methods, and the <code>IGrouping</code>/<code>ILookup</code> interfaces. This achieves      source level compatibility with .NET 3.5, so if you upgrade from .NET 2.0 to .NET 3.5 you should      be able to replace the MiscUtil assembly with the .NET 3.5 version, recompile and everything should      still work. You could possibly get away with still using the .NET 2.0 version, but I'd recommend against      it - you'll have system types with the same name defined in two different places, which is never       a good place to be.      </p>    <p>      Each release comes with 5 files: a source zip file, a .NET 2.0 assembly, a .NET 3.5 assembly, a .NET 2.0      zip file (assembly, XML, licence, readme) and the same for .NET 3.5.    </p>    <p>      MiscUtil is now version stamped with the Subversion revision which built it. This is in the      <code>AssemblyFileVersion</code> attribute rather than the <code>AssemblyVersion</code> attribute      - the latter will stay at 1.0.0.0 for the foreseeable future. All released versions will now remain      available, rather than only the latest one.    </p>    <p>      MiscUtil is now strongly named. The key is shipped with the source so you can easily rebuild it      and keep the strong naming - this is for purposes of ease-of-use with other strongly named assemblies      instead of non-repudiation. If anyone ever wants a version which I've signed with a properly secured key,      I'm happy to do that - but I think the approach I've taken is the most pragmatic one for the moment.     </p>    <h2>Releases</h2>    <h4>r285, February 26th 2009</h4>    <p>      <a href="releases/r285/MiscUtil-Src-r285.zip">Source</a><br />      <a href="releases/r285/MiscUtil-DotNet2-r285.dll">.NET 2.0 assembly</a><br />      <a href="releases/r285/MiscUtil-r285.dll">.NET 3.5 assembly</a><br />      <a href="releases/r285/MiscUtil-DotNet2-r285.zip">.NET 2.0 assembly + XML + readme + licence</a><br />      <a href="releases/r285/MiscUtil-r285.zip">.NET 3.5 assembly + XML + readme + licence</a><br />    </p>    <p>      Changes:    </p>    <ul>      <li>Added extra overloads for StreamUtil.ReadExact to allow the offset to be specified</li>      <li>New "GenericMath" class for things like a generic version of Math.Abs</li>      <li>Better uses of type inference for creating SmartEnumerable</li>    </ul>    <h4>r279, February 24th 2009</h4>    <p>      <a href="releases/r279/MiscUtil-Src-r279.zip">Source</a><br />      <a href="releases/r279/MiscUtil-DotNet2-r279.dll">.NET 2.0 assembly</a><br />      <a href="releases/r279/MiscUtil-r279.dll">.NET 3.5 assembly</a><br />      <a href="releases/r279/MiscUtil-DotNet2-r279.zip">.NET 2.0 assembly + XML + readme + licence</a><br />      <a href="releases/r279/MiscUtil-r279.zip">.NET 3.5 assembly + XML + readme + licence</a><br />    </p>    <p>      Changes:    </p>    <ul>      <li>Fixed some unit test issues so we're green under Mono</li>      <li>Improved code formatting/using directives</li>      <li>Added <code>ReverseLineReader</code> for reading lines from the end of a stream (usually a file)</li>    </ul>    <h4>r271, November 23rd 2008</h4>    <p>      <a href="releases/r271/MiscUtil-Src-r271.zip">Source</a><br />      <a href="releases/r271/MiscUtil-DotNet2-r271.dll">.NET 2.0 assembly</a><br />      <a href="releases/r271/MiscUtil-r271.dll">.NET 3.5 assembly</a><br />      <a href="releases/r271/MiscUtil-DotNet2-r271.zip">.NET 2.0 assembly + XML + readme + licence</a><br />      <a href="releases/r271/MiscUtil-r271.zip">.NET 3.5 assembly + XML + readme + licence</a><br />    </p>    <p>      Changes:    </p>    <ul>      <li>Added <code>ProjectionEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;</code> to compare objects for equality via a projection.</li>      <li>Added <code>IComparer&lt;T&gt;.ThenBy</code> extension method to create a compound comparison.</li>      <li>Doc fix and optimisation for <code>Range</code>      <li>Added <code>DictionaryByType</code>: a mapping from a type to an instance of that type.      (See <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2008/10/08/mapping-from-a-type-to-an-instance-of-that-type.aspx">blog post</a>.)</li>      <li>Added <code>NonNullable</code> -

I can apply      bug fixes if requested, but I expect most people are now using .NET 2.0 anyway.
